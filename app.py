st.divider()
st.markdown("""
In this lab, we delve into the fascinating world of **time series analysis**, focusing on two fundamental models: **Moving Average (MA) processes** and **Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models**.

Understanding how time series data behaves is crucial in many fields, from finance and economics to engineering and environmental science. This application provides an interactive platform to:

1.  **Simulate and Visualize Moving Average (MA) Models:** Explore how different parameters (MA coefficients $\theta$ and white noise standard deviation $\sigma$) influence the shape of an MA time series and its Autocorrelation Function (ACF). You'll gain an intuitive understanding of the impact of past error terms on current observations.
2.  **Grasp Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) Models:** Learn about models that capture changing volatility in financial time series. While the interactive component for ARCH models is a future enhancement, this lab introduces the core concepts and mathematical formulations behind them.
